Featherlight
============

Featherlight is a very lightweight jQuery lightbox plugin. It is responsive, has
the ability to display captions with images, and can display multiple images in
a slideshow-like gallery.

This module provides a Featherlight field formatter, as well as the ability to
load the Featherlight library manually.

Installation
------------

- Install this module using the official Backdrop CMS instructions at
  https://backdropcms.org/guide/modules

- Visit the configuration page under Administration > Configuration > Media >
  Featherlight (admin/config/media/featherlight) to configure the global
  settings and/or enable manual use.

- Enable and configure the Featherlight field formatter in a content type
  display or a view where you have an image field.

  OR
